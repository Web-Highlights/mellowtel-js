# Introduction ℹ️

With Mellowtel's Open-Source library, your users can share a fraction of their unused internet by using a transparent opt-in/out mechanism. Trusted partners — from startups to enterprises — access the internet through this network to train their AI models, and you get paid for it.

**How?**

AI labs & startups need to access the web to train their models. They need a lot of publicly available data, and they need it fast. Mellowtel provides them with a way to access the internet at scale, by using a decentralized network of consensual users. You get a share of the revenue for providing access to your users' unused internet.

# Key Features 🎯

- **Easy to use**: Monetize your Browser plugins with a few lines of code.
- **Open-source**: Transparency is at the core of Mellowtel. Our code is open-source and available for everyone.
- **Consensual & Opt-out by default**: We believe in the power of informed consent. Your users are always in control. Only they decide if they want to support your extension through an explicit opt-in mechanism (not some small print in TOS). They can opt-out at any time.
- **Non-intrusive & Private**: We do not collect, share, or sell personal information (not even anonymized data). Mellowtel doesn't negatively affect user experience.
- **Highly regulated**: We keep communicating with Web Store DevRels in order to guarantee a safe experience. Mellowtel provides regulators with tools to monitor and enforce compliance (e.g. A custom dashboard to review every single URL that passes through the network)

# Why❓

We believe that extension developers should be able to monetize their work without compromising their users' privacy or experience. Most Browser plugins provide a lot of value to users, but they are not willing to pay for them.

Mellowtel gives your users a way to support your extension without having to directly pay for it. They can instead choose to share a fraction of their unused internet bandwidth. It's a win-win situation for everyone: users pay with a resource they didn't even know they had, and you get paid for your work.

Hopefully this will lead to fewer extensions being shut down or discontinued due to inability to monetize, fewer personal data being collected and sold, and more transparency in the Browser plugins ecosystem.

See other "monetization solutions" below for examples of what can go wrong when developers are not given a fair way to monetize their work.

# What are the current "monetization solutions"? 🧐

We have been developing Browser plugins and trying to monetize them for years. We, too, received a hefty amount of the "monetization solutions" emails.

Well, honestly, most attempts to monetize Browser plugins are just shady at best and total scams at worst. They either buy your extension or provide SDKs that collect and sell your users' personal data (credit card information, addresses), spoof their passwords, inject unwanted ads into your extension, inject affiliate links, etc.

And a highlight from the article 😰:

> "...we provide several methods of monetizating- from the soft to the hard methods."
